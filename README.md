Bane here.  

I work on a variety of things that catch my interest, or perhaps I need for a particular reason.  
Useful packages, userstyles, userscripts, shaders, gamedev, non-game software, tools to make using other software easier... You name it, I've probably touched on it a little bit.  

I recommend you go check out [my userstyles](https://jordy3d.github.io/banecss) if you want to get a dark style for a site you may use; some of them have quite the number of users, mayhaps you can be among them! [My style for MAL](https://userstyles.world/style/873/al-mal) has surpassed 4K installs!

Recently I've been getting back into the swing of C# a little, while also exploring JS again. [My userscripts](https://jordy3d.github.io/userscripts) may be somewhat "unique" at times, but I hope they provide help and fun for at least 1 person.
I've also also been developing and maintaining a bot for the Hacksmith server which started off as a way to receive YouTube notifications that differentiate between Shorts and regular videos, but now incorporates a number of automation features to make our lives a bit easier.

Some of my more useful and/or ready projects include:
- [a video display application](https://github.com/GlitcherOG/Capture-Display) in order to make use of certain shitty USB HDMI capture devices
- [a taskbar media controller](https://github.com/Jordy3D/Taskplay), reviving a 6-ish year old application that had a few people requesting features
- [a "working" Star Wars Crawl generator](https://jordy3d.github.io/StarWarsCrawl/) that has a larger text limit than others I found, thanks to utilising 3D objects in Unity

In the last 6 years, I've studied game art, game programming, graphic design, video editing, and web design, among other things.  
While I may not be the best at anything, I'm more than willing to try and learn.
